# üí´ About Me:
Hello, my name is Siarhei, and I'm a QA Engineer with over a year of experience in manual testing. In addition to my manual testing experience, I can write automated tests in Java using the Selenide framework. I also have experience with Git, Allure, Cucumber, Gherkin, Jenkins, and BDD.

In addition, I have experience working with databases and am proficient in SQL. I also have experience with API testing using tools such as Postman and SoapUI. I am skilled in using developer tools and Jira to track issues and manage projects.

As a detail-oriented and analytical thinker, I'm committed to delivering high-quality work. I am a collaborative team player with good communication skills, and my English level is Upper Intermediate.

If you're looking for a QA Engineer who is passionate about testing and has experience with a variety of testing tools and methodologies, I would love to connect with you. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities.
